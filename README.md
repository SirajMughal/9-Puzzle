# 9-Puzzle
This program is based off of the game "sliding puzzle" where you have a 3 X 3 board with 8 blocks. Each block has a number 1 through 8 on it, and the remaining 9th block is empty. The objective of the game is to use the empty space to slide the other 8 blocks around so the board has numbers 1 through 8 in order, with the empty space being in the bottom right corner. You may only shift a neighboring block into the empty space. The file "example" gives a visual representation of how the game works. The objective of this program is to solve this problem with as few moves as possible. The input is read as a sequence of 9 numbers (1-9), with the number 9 being the blank space. The first 3 numbers represent the first row, the next 3 representing the second row, and the last 3 representing the bottom row. The output shows the beginning state of the board, and is followed by the shortest moves until the problem is solved. For example, if the input is 123489765, the output should be: 123489765 123485769 123485796 123495786 123459786 123456789 If there board is unsolvable, the output should be -1.
